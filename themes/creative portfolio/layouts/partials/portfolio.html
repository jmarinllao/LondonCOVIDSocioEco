<p>INSIGHTS:</p> # TOREWRITTE/IMPROVE
                            Starting from a similar average activity in all sectors, we can see the peaks prior to lockdown in grocery (where the population was supplied by these -especially toilet paper as reported in the media-) and the beginning of the decrease in the rest of the activities. Weekend peaks are also observed, especially in ‘Social’. 
Then there is the drastic decline in all activities with the imposition of the first lockdown, with the most affected sectors being reservations for restaurants and and ‘social’, and a less drastic change for food and pharmacy products. It is also observed that while during the lockdown the most affected sectors remain stationary with very low activity, as the lockdown progresses if trade in general, both food and recreational, is recovering, remaining with a significantly higher activity. elevated food and basic necessities.
With the lifting of the first lockdown, all sectors are exploring a linear recovery during the summer, but without having recovered the activity of pre-pandemic 'normality', if several points -outliers- are observed, probably due to the holiday periods and back to work. Grocery stores are ahead of the rest of the sector.
Given the restrictions applied with the second September wave, the two most punished sectors 'social' and 'restaurant reservations' return to low levels of lockdown, and trade and recreation also fall, while grocery and pharmacist products do not experience in this case any downfall.

                                The drastic downfall is highlighted in all types of transport. In this case however the trends are more homogeneous than in commercial activity case. All types of transport diminish with the first home lockdown, although they are unmarked during confinement, being the 'Journeys' the most damaged.
If it is also observed that the Transit stations stand out above transport by car, probably because it was the type of displacement was made during the confinement for a population sample that does not have a car (not average and for work) .
Traffic by car rises with the uprising of the restrictions, imposing over the rest, probably due that many users considered it safer to avoid contagious, despite denoting a global devaluous transit with respect to pre-pandemic levels during this Summer period of normality.
With the restrictions applied again in November, a drastic devastation was shown, although with an incidence of greater transit at the levels of the first confinement, probably because in this case they are dealt with more permissive measures.

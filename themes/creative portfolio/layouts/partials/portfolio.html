<p>INSIGHTS:</p> 
                            Starting from a similar average activity in all sectors, we can see the peaks prior to lockdown in grocery (where the population was supplied by these -especially toilet paper as reported in the media-) and the beginning of the decrease in the rest of the activities. Weekend peaks are also observed, especially in ‘Social’. 
Then there is the drastic decline in all activities with the imposition of the first lockdown, with the most affected sectors being reservations for restaurants and and ‘social’, and a less drastic change for food and pharmacy products. It is also observed that while during the lockdown the most affected sectors remain stationary with very low activity, as the lockdown progresses if trade in general, both food and recreational, is recovering, remaining with a significantly higher activity. elevated food and basic necessities.
With the lifting of the first lockdown, all sectors are exploring a linear recovery during the summer, but without having recovered the activity of pre-pandemic 'normality', if several points -outliers- are observed, probably due to the holiday periods and back to work. Grocery stores are ahead of the rest of the sector.
Given the restrictions applied with the second September wave, the two most punished sectors 'social' and 'restaurant reservations' return to low levels of lockdown, and trade and recreation also fall, while grocery and pharmacist products do not experience in this case any downfall. Finally a postpandemic recovery is noticed from March on, almost recovering prepandemic activity.

This model calculates the performance of “Grocery and pharmacy”, “Social”, “Restaurant” and “Restaurant and recreation” according to a COVID level. The COVID level is given by the number of daily cases and vaccines administered. The lower the daily cases and the higher the vaccines doses are, the lower the COVID level will be.  In the dropdown list, a neighbourhood can be selected and the performance for each business will be calculated for that specific neighbourhood. It is interesting to note that, no matter the neighbourhood or COVID level, the performance of groceries and pharmacy remains almost in 100 for all neighbourhoods. Contrary to this, retail and recreation seems to be the kind of business with most difficulties to recover, since even with the lowest COVID level, remains only around 80 for all neighbourhoods. On the other hand, social and restaurants are the ones that varies the most depending on COVID level. These variations are mainly due to restrictions. The higher the COVID cases are, the stricter the restrictions get. Restrictions affect differently to each kind of businesses. Groceries and pharmacies are not affected by restrictions they can remain open even during the lockdowns. As for retail, it is affected by restrictions but there is still the option for online shopping, so it makes sense that the performance does not change that much according to COVID level. Lastly, restaurants and social are the most affected by restrictions and, therefore by COVID level, since the need to be closed down when high COVID levels.

<p><strong>This plot reports the main socio-economical indicators. We relate them with vaccinations, covid19 cases and Lockdown measures. Everything is scaled according to covid-19 cases. They activities are measured as increase or decrease in percentage of volume of affairs.</strong></p>
<p>The boxed areas are the periods when Great britain faced the <strong>strongest</strong> period of restrictions. <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pd"> [Timeline of UK lockdowns]</a> Anyway minor restrictions went on for periods out of the lockdowns, clearly shown by many trends.</p>
<p>INSIGHTS:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's interesting to point out the <strong>effectiveness of lockdowns</strong>. Giving a first look of data seem that the first 2 lockdowns didn't helped that much, but seeing the trend of the second (great increase rate) stopping the increasing curve at the beginning it's fundamental. Moreover, we know that "an effective reduction in transmission must have occurred nearly immediately after the tighter lockdown, given the lag time of around 10 days from asymptomatic infection to diagnosis." Taking that into account we can clearly see that after a small time lag infections started to decrease <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30201-7/fulltext">[Lockdown timing and efficacy in controlling COVID-19]</a></li>
<li>Taking a look into activities behavior we can clearly see that, for instance, social econimcal activities had very few volume of affair during lockdowns, due to strict regulamentations of customers number and take-away only. This category is clearly the one that covid had the worse impact to, reducing retail volume dramaticaly for the whole restriction periods.</li>
<li>Contrarywise, we can see that grocieries and pharmacies after an initial drop in sales volume remained active with a slightly increasing rate. It's important to notice a huge drop in thei sales in late december, obviously related to Christmas days.</li>
<li><strong>We can clearly see that during weekends we have a decreasing in cases number</strong>, this is due to the fact that "testing is not functioning seven days a week, unlike Covid-19". <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/covid-19-cases-and-the-weekend-effect"> [Covid-19 cases and the weekend effect]</a></li>
<li>5) Another interesting fact is that London (and the whole Great Britain actually) faced much more cases in the lastCovid-19 wave. It's difficult to say why. According to what Time : "experts say [...] the crisis is a result of both the struggle to deal with a new variant estimated to be up to 70% more transmissible, and because of a failure in decisive and strong government leadership. " We can infact clearly see that cases dropped after the last hard restrictions took place. <a href="https://time.com/5929246/uk-coronavirus-third-wave/"> [Third wave of covid in Great Britain]</a></li>
<li>Least, but not last It's interesting to highlight that decreasing in retail/moving are not directly following covid cases but more follow the restrictions. And that decrease actually stopped the virus. This again shows how much restrictions are important since people without law enforcement do not realize the importance of not spreding the virus.</li>

                             <p><strong>Evolution of transport activity  during the pandemic.</strong></p>
<p>As in the previous plot a imeline is rendered with the diferent relevant events and periods that distinguished the pandemic cicles and the correspondent restrictions, being able to interactively explore them with their description at the bottom to assess the social activity trends and impact. <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pd"> [Timeline of UK lockdowns]</a>.</p>
<p>INSIGHTS:</p> 
 The drastic downfall is noticed in all types of transport at the beginning of the pandemic (but in remote work indicators). In this case however the trends are more homogeneous than in commercial activity case. All types of transport diminish with the first home lockdown, although they are unmarked during confinement, being the 'Journeys' the most damaged.
If it is also observed that the Transit stations stand out above transport by car, probably because it was the type of displacement was made during the confinement for a population sample that does not have a car (not average and for work) .
Traffic by car rises with the uprising of the restrictions, imposing over the rest, probably due that many users considered it safer to avoid contagious, despite denoting a global devaluous transit with respect to pre-pandemic levels during this Summer period of normality.
With the restrictions applied again in November, a drastic devastation was shown, although with an incidence of greater transit at the levels of the first confinement, probably because in this case they are dealt with more permissive measures.
